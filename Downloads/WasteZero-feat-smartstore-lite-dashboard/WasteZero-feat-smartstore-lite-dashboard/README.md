> **An intelligent retail waste management and sustainability dashboard designed to help retail stores reduce inventory waste and optimize energy consumption using AI-powered analytics and predictive modeling.**

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

WasteZero addresses two critical challenges faced by retail businesses:
- **Inventory Waste Management** - Predicting and preventing product expiry/waste
- **Energy Optimization** - Reducing energy costs through smart scheduling

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🍎 **Waste Prediction System**
- **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Analyzes 150+ products across 7 categories
- **Intelligent Expiry Logic**: Category-specific expiry types (Shelf Life, Warranty Period, Fashion Season, etc.)
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Automatically calculates optimal risk thresholds
- **Real-time Risk Scoring**: Identifies products at risk of waste
- **Financial Impact Analysis**: Shows potential losses in thousands of dollars

### 🚨 **Emergency Alert System**
- **URGENT Alerts**: Products expiring within 7 days
- **OVERSTOCK Alerts**: Products with excessive inventory levels
- **NO SALES Alerts**: Products with zero demand in 30 days
- **Color-coded Notifications**: Red, yellow, and blue alerts for immediate attention

### 💡 **Energy Optimization**
- **Footfall Analysis**: Infers customer patterns from sales data
- **Smart Scheduling**: Recommends optimal lighting/AC schedules
- **Peak Hour Detection**: Identifies busy periods (lunch 12-2 PM, evening 5-7 PM)
- **Cost Savings Calculator**: Shows daily energy and cost savings

### ♻️ **GreenScore Sustainability Rating**
- **Composite Score**: 60% waste reduction + 40% energy savings
- **Real-time Calculation**: Updates based on current inventory and energy usage
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded scores (Green=Good, Orange=Moderate, Red=Poor)

### 🏭 **Supplier Analytics**
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates supplier reliability and performance
- **Delivery Analysis**: Tracks delivery times and consistency
- **Inventory Value Tracking**: Monitors supplier-specific inventory worth
- **Recommendations**: Suggests supplier improvements and alternatives

## 🛠 **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, Custom algorithms
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Data Storage**: CSV files (can be extended to databases)

## 📊 **Demo Data**

The application includes realistic sample data:
- **150 Products** across 7 categories (Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, Home Goods, Books, Beauty & Health, Sports & Outdoors)
- **2000+ Sales Records** with realistic patterns
- **20 Suppliers** with performance metrics
- **Employee Schedules** for operational insights
