# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import key functions here to make them directly accessible
# from the 'utils' package, e.g.:
# from .waste_prediction import predict_expiring_products
# from .schedule_optimization import recommend_lighting_ac_schedule
# from .greenscore import calculate_greenscore

# For this project, direct imports from modules (e.g., from utils.waste_prediction import ...)
# are clear enough, so this file can remain empty or with comments.
